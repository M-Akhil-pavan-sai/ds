Check if the nfs-utils package is installed or not:
#rpm –q nfs-utils (Prints a message whether package is installed or not)
#rpm –q portmap
To reinstall the package first remove it with the following commands:
#servicesnfs stop
#rpm –e nfs-utils
#rm –rf /var/lib/nfs/xtab-------- remove
If package is not installed then there are two ways to install:

1. Download from FTP and install
#ping the server
#rpm –ivhftp://192.168.0.250:/pub.RedHat/RPMS/nfs* --force –aid
2. Install from CD
#mount /dev/cdrom/mnt
#cd /mnt
#ls
#cd Fedora
34#cd RPMS
#rpm –ivhnfs-utils* --force –aid
#rpm –ivhportmap* --force –aid
After installing the nfs-utils package create file as below:
#vi /etc/exports
/var/ftp/pub 192.168.0.0./24(ro,sync)
/nfsshare 192.168.0.0.24(rw,sync)
Note:in vi-editor write this content (/nfsshare server ipaddress and no. of systems that are connected in
network)
After installing services enter the command to restart
#servicesnfs restart
Note: execute this command twice because first it will show failed second time it will show ok.
Access to NFS share from client:
#mount –t nfs 10.10.12.114:/nfsshare/mnt
Note: In client machine enter Server Ipaddress
Note:
1) #ping 192.168.0.3 –b
Broadcasts the address in the network only.
2) #ssh 192.168.0.8
Connects the PC to another PC just like Terminal connection in Windows.
3) In NFS all files & Directory are by default in read only mode.
